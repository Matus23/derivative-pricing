# derivative-pricing

This repository contains interactive tutorials on the basics of financial derivatives and their pricing. The tutorials are in jupyter notebook and contain plotly charts. Unfortunately github doesn't display the plotly charts by default and the jupyter notebooks have to be run locally do display and interact with them.
