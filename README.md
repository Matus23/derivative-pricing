# derivative-pricing

This repository contains interactive tutorials on the basics of financial derivatives and their pricing. The tutorials are in jupyter notebook and contain interactive plotly charts. Unfortunately github doesn't display plotly charts by default and the jupyter notebooks have to be run locally to display them.
